# Going Dutch

This project is an app prototype (ie, you can view this on a desktop, but it's intended for a phone screen) designed to help people split a check evenly. The app uses an OCR library called Tessarect to recognize images, turn pictures of receipts into interactive elements, and allow a user to divide up the check proportionally among friends. I used this project as a refresher in plain javascript to re-familiarize myself with the basics.

### Stack
- Plain Javascript
- Tessarect.js

### Issues
- Interface needs to be cleaned up
- Tessarect scanning is unreliable, need to research a way to upscale image before sending it to b escanned
- Clicking on text boxes does not do anything yet
- Photos auto-rotate
